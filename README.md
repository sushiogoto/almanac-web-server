## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The first time it may take a little while to generate the first `webpack-assets.json` and complain with a few dozen `[webpack-isomorphic-tools] (waiting for the first Webpack build to finish)` printouts, but be patient. Give it 30 seconds.

### Using Redux DevTools

In development, Redux Devtools are enabled by default. You can toggle visibility and move the dock around using the following keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> Toggle DevTools Dock
- <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> Move Dock Position
- see [redux-devtools-dock-monitor](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools-dock-monitor) for more detail information.

If you have the [Redux DevTools chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) installed it will automatically be used on the client-side instead.

## Building and Running Production Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
